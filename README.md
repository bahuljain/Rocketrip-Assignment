# Twitter Keyword search

This program returns a random tweet based on a keyword search. The program accepts keywords from command prompt.

### Setup

1. All the dependencies for the program to run are listed in the requirements.txt file.
2. One way to install the dependencies are to create a new virtual environment. This can be done by following command...

```
$ virtualenv twitter
```

3. To load the virtual environment run the following command...

```
$ source twitter/venv/activate
```

4. Now to install all the requirements run the following command. You can directly run the following command without creating a virtual environment as well (these libraries will be installed globally)...

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
