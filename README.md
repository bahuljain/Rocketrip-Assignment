# Twitter Keyword Search

This program returns a random tweet based on a keyword search. The program
accepts keywords from command prompt.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip and then unzip it.

2. All the dependencies for the program to run are listed in the
requirements.txt file.

3. Now to install all the requirements run the following command. An alternate
and cleaner way would be to create a virtual machine and run the command below
inside the virtual environment.

  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. Done

### Run the program

- To run the program, simply run the following command in the terminal from within
the repository.

  ```
  $ python tweet-search.py 'keyword-1' 'keyword-2' 'keyword-3'
  ```

- Any number of space separated single/double-quoted keywords can be passed as
arguments.

- A tweet will be searched and printed for each keyword entered.



Any feedback is appreciated :)
